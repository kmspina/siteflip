        <ul>
          <li> General Requirements for Acceptance to a Psychology Study Abroad Program
            <ul>
              <li> Completion of the required application and supporting materials by the due date (May 1 or
February 1 for the spring and fall semesters, respectively) </li>
              <li> Completion of 9 (for fall semester) or 12 (for spring semester) units of graded psychology
(L33 or U09) classes. (If the student has received an exemption from Psy 300, there still
must be the necessary units of graded psychology classes completed.) </li>
              <li> A minimum of a 3.00 psychology GPA (including the course used to satisfy the statistics
requirement) as of the end of the spring semester in which the application is due if applying
for the following spring, or as of the end of the fall semester if applying for the following
fall </li>
              <li> A minimum of a 3.00 overall GPA as of the end of the spring semester in which the
application is due if applying for the following spring, or as of the end of the fall semester if
applying for the following fall </li>
              <li> Evidence that Psy 301 or 3011 (Experimental Psychology) has been or will be completed
(e.g., registration for 301/3011) before going abroad. Please note that Psy 300 (Statistics) is
a prerequisite for Psy 301. </li>
            </ul>
    <li> All of the preceding requirements must be met before a student will be considered for acceptance
to the program. Final acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the student’s academic
transcript, letters of recommendation, and statement of purpose. In addition, no fewer than 13
units of psychology classes, including Psy 301 or 3011 (Experimental Psychology), must be
completed before going abroad, and a minimum 3.00 GPA overall and in psychology must be
maintained.
Students interested in pursuing a Study Abroad Program must make an appointment with the
Psychology Department’s Coordinator for Study Abroad, who must approve the application and
proposed classes prior to the application deadline. For the Queensland program, see Dr. Joel
Myerson (room 415A; myerson.joel@gmail.com); for the programs in the UK, Copenhagen,
Haifa, and Chile, see Professor Leonard Green (room 415B; lgreen@wustl.edu).
All questions regarding housing, costs, additional requirements, when transfer credits will show
on your transcript, etc., are handled through Overseas Programs in the Office of International
Studies (phone: 935-5958; e-mail: overseas@artsci.wustl.edu) </li> </p>

      <h3> Information for Students Applying to a Psychology Study Abroad Program</h3>
      <p>The Psychology Study Abroad Programs are meant to enrich students’ study of psychology as
well as their general education. They are not meant to be a way to complete the minimum
requirements of the major. With that in mind, please be aware that psychology classes taken
abroad cannot be used to satisfy the distribution requirements in psychology (i.e., the
requirement of one class from each of the three core areas).
You must receive prior approval for any psychology class you are considering taking abroad. In
considering possible classes, it is advisable that on your Study Plan you list more than the
minimum number so that there will be little problem should a class not be offered or you decide
to switch classes. If you wish to enroll in a class for which you have not been pre-approved, then
you must obtain permission from the Psychology Study Abroad Program advisors at the abroad
university and at WU.
After acceptance to a Study Abroad Program in Psychology that requires a research component
(i.e., Sussex, Queensland), you will be asked to indicate your preference for a mentor to oversee
your research assistantship at the host institution. (For the Haifa program, the research
involvement will be developed upon arrival.) We will try to place you with a research mentor
consistent with your preference, but there are limited openings with any individual mentor and as
a consequence, we might not be able to accommodate your stated preferences. In such cases, we
will contact you to see if an alternative mentor is acceptable. After students have been assigned
a research mentor, a list of required readings will be provided to familiarize the student with the
mentor’s research area. It is expected that the student will have read these articles before
arriving at the abroad university.
A description of the requirements and expectations of the research assistantship is provided
below. As part of the research assistantship, each student completes either a literature review or
a research paper (determined in consultation with the research mentor). The research mentor
will determine what, if any, additional written work is required.

      <h3> Portfolio Material to be Turned in upon Returning from Study Abroad </h3>
      <p>Upon returning to Washington University, and no later than October 1 for those who studied
abroad in the spring semester or February 1 for those who studied abroad in the fall semester, the
student must hand in the required Portfolio material to the Washington University Psychology
Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator before any transfer credit will be awarded.
The required Portfolio includes (1) all syllabi of classes taken abroad, (2) copies of
psychology course papers, (3) the literature/research paper based on the student’s research
assistantship, and (4) the 3-page Reflection Essay along with the responses to the six
additional questions (see below).
        <ul>
          <li> Literature Review/Research Paper:
            <ul>
              <li> The literature review/research paper must be written
following APA format, and the main body of the text (from the page after the abstract to the page
before the references) typically should be at least 10 pages long. Literature reviews should be
written like articles in Psychological Bulletin, and research reports should be written like articles
in one of the experimental psychology journals (i.e., like your final independent research paper
for Psy 301/3011). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Reflection Essay:
            <ul>
              <li>  As part of your study abroad experience, and before transfer credit
will be awarded, we ask that you submit a reflection essay. The essay, 3 pages in length,
should provide thoughtful and honest feedback. The essay is to describe your intellectual
growth -- and specifically your growth as a student of psychology -- during the time abroad.
We would like reflections on how the approaches taken in your courses abroad and any
research on which you were engaged affected your development, your view of the discipline,
your growth as a student of psychology, and how the educational structure of the host
university influenced the way you learned.  </li>
            </ul>
            <li> In addition to the reflection essay, you need also respond to each of the following:
              <ul>
                <li>1- How did the study-abroad program meet your academic and intellectual needs? If it
failed to do so, then where and how did it fall short (please be specific). </li>
                <li> 2- How did the program help in meeting personal goals in terms of cultural or community
engagement? If it failed to do so, then please say why.</li>
                <li> 3- Please comment briefly on the sufficiency of the infrastructure and support the program
offered (e.g., on-site programming, facilities, housing, safety and well-being, etc.).</li>
                <li> 4- Are there specific aspects or components of the program, positive and/or negative, that
were not anticipated but would be important for us or our students to know about?</li>
                <li> 5- Why would, or would you not, recommend the program to other Wash U psychology
students? </li>
                <li> 6- Anything else to mention about the program or your experience? </li>
</ul>
             </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h3> Policies for Optional Concentrations </h3>
      <p>Each optional concentration requires nine units of course work.
        A student may pursue only one optional concentration.
        Courses applied to an optional concentration may not be used to fulfill any other requirement for the major.
        If two courses completed for an optional concentration fall within the same distribution, then that distribution is satisfied.
        These optional concentrations are available only to University College students admitted to a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Psychology.
