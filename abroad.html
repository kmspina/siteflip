      <h3> Information for Students Applying to a Psychology Study Abroad Program</h3>
      <p>The Psychology Study Abroad Programs are meant to enrich students’ study of psychology as
well as their general education. They are not meant to be a way to complete the minimum
requirements of the major. With that in mind, please be aware that psychology classes taken
abroad cannot be used to satisfy the distribution requirements in psychology (i.e., the
requirement of one class from each of the three core areas).
You must receive prior approval for any psychology class you are considering taking abroad. In
considering possible classes, it is advisable that on your Study Plan you list more than the
minimum number so that there will be little problem should a class not be offered or you decide
to switch classes. If you wish to enroll in a class for which you have not been pre-approved, then
you must obtain permission from the Psychology Study Abroad Program advisors at the abroad
university and at WU.
After acceptance to a Study Abroad Program in Psychology that requires a research component
(i.e., Sussex, Queensland), you will be asked to indicate your preference for a mentor to oversee
your research assistantship at the host institution. (For the Haifa program, the research
involvement will be developed upon arrival.) We will try to place you with a research mentor
consistent with your preference, but there are limited openings with any individual mentor and as
a consequence, we might not be able to accommodate your stated preferences. In such cases, we
will contact you to see if an alternative mentor is acceptable. After students have been assigned
a research mentor, a list of required readings will be provided to familiarize the student with the
mentor’s research area. It is expected that the student will have read these articles before
arriving at the abroad university.
A description of the requirements and expectations of the research assistantship is provided
below. As part of the research assistantship, each student completes either a literature review or
a research paper (determined in consultation with the research mentor). The research mentor
will determine what, if any, additional written work is required.

      <h3> Portfolio Material to be Turned in upon Returning from Study Abroad </h3>
      <p>Upon returning to Washington University, and no later than October 1 for those who studied
abroad in the spring semester or February 1 for those who studied abroad in the fall semester, the
student must hand in the required Portfolio material to the Washington University Psychology
Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator before any transfer credit will be awarded.
The required Portfolio includes (1) all syllabi of classes taken abroad, (2) copies of
psychology course papers, (3) the literature/research paper based on the student’s research
assistantship, and (4) the 3-page Reflection Essay along with the responses to the six
additional questions (see below).
        <ul>
          <li> Literature Review/Research Paper:
            <ul>
              <li> The literature review/research paper must be written
following APA format, and the main body of the text (from the page after the abstract to the page
before the references) typically should be at least 10 pages long. Literature reviews should be
written like articles in Psychological Bulletin, and research reports should be written like articles
in one of the experimental psychology journals (i.e., like your final independent research paper
for Psy 301/3011). </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> Reflection Essay:
            <ul>
              <li>  As part of your study abroad experience, and before transfer credit
will be awarded, we ask that you submit a reflection essay. The essay, 3 pages in length,
should provide thoughtful and honest feedback. The essay is to describe your intellectual
growth -- and specifically your growth as a student of psychology -- during the time abroad.
We would like reflections on how the approaches taken in your courses abroad and any
research on which you were engaged affected your development, your view of the discipline,
your growth as a student of psychology, and how the educational structure of the host
university influenced the way you learned.  </li>
            </ul>
            <li> In addition to the reflection essay, you need also respond to each of the following:
              <ul>
                <li>1- How did the study-abroad program meet your academic and intellectual needs? If it
failed to do so, then where and how did it fall short (please be specific). </li>
                <li> 2- How did the program help in meeting personal goals in terms of cultural or community
engagement? If it failed to do so, then please say why.</li>
                <li> 3- Please comment briefly on the sufficiency of the infrastructure and support the program
offered (e.g., on-site programming, facilities, housing, safety and well-being, etc.).</li>
                <li> 4- Are there specific aspects or components of the program, positive and/or negative, that
were not anticipated but would be important for us or our students to know about?</li>
                <li> 5- Why would, or would you not, recommend the program to other Wash U psychology
students? </li>
                <li> 6- Anything else to mention about the program or your experience? </li>
</ul>

      <h3> Additional General Information about the Awarding of Transfer Credit </h3>
      <p>Decisions regarding the award of transfer credit for non-psychology classes taken abroad (and
determination if they may count for other majors, minors, or distribution requirements) are made
by the appropriate WU department or the Dean’s Office.
Evaluation of the courses and appropriate transfer of credits is not done until after we receive the
official transcript from the abroad university. Upon receipt of the official transcript and after the
Portfolio materials have been received and approved, an evaluation of the record will be made
and appropriate credits awarded. Please understand that this may take a while because of the
time involved in receiving the transcript, processing it, and then sending it to the appropriate
departments for their evaluation and on to the Dean’s Office for recording. Please note that no
transfer credit will be granted until all the required Portfolio materials are received and approved.
As part of the evaluation, you are required to bring all materials from your classes abroad so that
a determination of their equivalency to WU courses can be made and appropriate credit assigned.
Be sure to bring back all syllabi, course descriptions, papers and written assignments (or copies),
along with materials handed out in class. Remember that copies of the literature review/research
paper, as well as the required Reflection paper, must be provided to the Washington University
Psychology Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator by the deadline and before transfer credit
will be granted.
Study	Abroad	- 5
The actual grades received from the host school do not transfer to your academic record at
Washington University, but you should bear in mind that if you apply to graduate or professional
school, official transcripts will be required both from Washington University and from the
abroad university (as well as any other schools at which you have studied). Thus, even though
the grades from abroad do not show on your WU transcript, professional and graduate schools
will see the grades on the foreign transcript. The Study Abroad Office will have copies of your
official transcript from the host institution. You may contact our Study Abroad Office for
details.
During the time you are abroad, and until the evaluation and transfer of credits is completed,
your academic record at Washington University will show registration for 12 units of L99. This
serves as a placeholder to maintain your status as a full-time student. The actual number of
credits transferred will be determined after receipt and evaluation of the official transcript from
the abroad university (see above).
When you return, you will be able to see transfer credit on your record on WebSTAC.
Specifically, if you look at the semester when you studied abroad, you will see your L99
placeholder course, L99 OSP with a number. If you have received the credits from your study
abroad, then you will see 0 units as the number of credits for the semester (with a grade of N). If
you see a number other than zero, then this is still the placeholder credit and your credit has not
yet been processed. For the credits to be processed, Overseas Programs must receive an original
transcript from your program abroad and your email response to the credit request. In addition,
the Psychology Study Abroad Coordinator also must have received the required materials (e.g.,
syllabi, APA-style literature/research report, reflection paper) before you can be awarded credit.
To find your credits from abroad once they have been posted on your student record, you need to
look in the ‘Other Credits’ section. The courses will show up in list format with a department
(e.g., L14 English, L33 Psychology) and course number (e.g., 314 or 3ABR) and number of
credits (e.g., 3). The title of your course will show up as COURSEWORK COMPLETED
ABROAD or as a specific course title. Your study abroad program will show up under
‘Comments.’
