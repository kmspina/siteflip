      <h2> Information for Students Applying to a Psychology Study Abroad Program</h2>
      <p>The Psychology Study Abroad Programs are meant to enrich students’ study of psychology as well as their general education. They are not meant to be a way to complete the minimum requirements of the major. With that in mind, please be aware that psychology classes taken abroad cannot be used to satisfy the distribution requirements in psychology (i.e., the
requirement of one class from each of the three core areas). You must receive prior approval for any psychology class you are considering taking abroad. In considering possible classes, it is advisable that on your Study Plan you list more than the minimum number so that there will be little problem should a class not be offered or you decide to switch classes. If you wish to enroll in a class for which you have not been pre-approved, then you must obtain permission from the Psychology Study Abroad Program advisors at the abroad university and at WU. After acceptance to a Study Abroad Program in Psychology that requires a research component
(i.e., Sussex, Queensland), you will be asked to indicate your preference for a mentor to oversee your research assistantship at the host institution. (For the Haifa program, the research involvement will be developed upon arrival.) We will try to place you with a research mentor consistent with your preference, but there are limited openings with any individual mentor and as a consequence, we might not be able to accommodate your stated preferences. In such cases, we will contact you to see if an alternative mentor is acceptable. After students have been assigned a research mentor, a list of required readings will be provided to familiarize the student with the mentor’s research area. It is expected that the student will have read these articles before arriving at the abroad university. A description of the requirements and expectations of the research assistantship is provided below. As part of the research assistantship, each student completes either a literature review or a research paper (determined in consultation with the research mentor). The research mentor will determine what, if any, additional written work is required.

      <h2> Portfolio Material to be Turned in upon Returning from Study Abroad </h2>
      <p>Upon returning to Washington University, and no later than October 1 for those who studied abroad in the spring semester or February 1 for those who studied abroad in the fall semester, the student must hand in the required Portfolio material to the Washington University Psychology Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator before any transfer credit will be awarded.
The required Portfolio includes (1) all syllabi of classes taken abroad, (2) copies of psychology course papers, (3) the literature/research paper based on the student’s research assistantship, and (4) the 3-page Reflection Essay along with the responses to the six additional questions (see below).
  </div> <!-- end box -->

    <div class="box grid_4">
      <h6> Literature Review/Research Paper: </h6>
            <p>The literature review/research paper must be written following APA format, and the main body of the text (from the page after the abstract to the page before the references) typically should be at least 10 pages long. Literature reviews should be
written like articles in Psychological Bulletin, and research reports should be written like articles in one of the experimental psychology journals (i.e., like your final independent research paper for Psy 301/3011).</p>
    </div> <!-- end box -->

    <div class="box grid_3">
          <h6> Reflection Essay: </h6>
            <p>As part of your study abroad experience, and before transfer credit will be awarded, we ask that you submit a reflection essay. The essay, 3 pages in length, should provide thoughtful and honest feedback. The essay is to describe your intellectual growth -- and specifically your growth as a student of psychology -- during the time abroad.
We would like reflections on how the approaches taken in your courses abroad and any research on which you were engaged affected your development, your view of the discipline, your growth as a student of psychology, and how the educational structure of the host university influenced the way you learned.  </li>

                <li>How did the study-abroad program meet your academic and intellectual needs? If it
failed to do so, then where and how did it fall short (please be specific). </li>
                <li>How did the program help in meeting personal goals in terms of cultural or community
engagement? If it failed to do so, then please say why.</li>
                <li>Please comment briefly on the sufficiency of the infrastructure and support the program
offered (e.g., on-site programming, facilities, housing, safety and well-being, etc.).</li>
                <li>Are there specific aspects or components of the program, positive and/or negative, that
were not anticipated but would be important for us or our students to know about?</li>
                <li>Why would, or would you not, recommend the program to other Wash U psychology
students? </li>

      <h2> Additional General Information about the Awarding of Transfer Credit </h2>
      <p>Decisions regarding the award of transfer credit for non-psychology classes taken abroad (and determination if they may count for other majors, minors, or distribution requirements) are made
by the appropriate WU department or the Dean’s Office.
<br>
Evaluation of the courses and appropriate transfer of credits is not done until after we receive the official transcript from the abroad university. Upon receipt of the official transcript and after the Portfolio materials have been received and approved, an evaluation of the record will be made and appropriate credits awarded. Please understand that this may take a while because of the
time involved in receiving the transcript, processing it, and then sending it to the appropriate departments for their evaluation and on to the Dean’s Office for recording. Please note that no transfer credit will be granted until all the required Portfolio materials are received and approved. As part of the evaluation, you are required to bring all materials from your classes abroad so that
a determination of their equivalency to WU courses can be made and appropriate credit assigned. Be sure to bring back all syllabi, course descriptions, papers and written assignments (or copies), along with materials handed out in class. Remember that copies of the literature review/research paper, as well as the required Reflection paper, must be provided to the Washington University Psychology Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator by the deadline and before transfer credit will be granted.
<br>
The actual grades received from the host school do not transfer to your academic record at Washington University, but you should bear in mind that if you apply to graduate or professional school, official transcripts will be required both from Washington University and from the abroad university (as well as any other schools at which you have studied). Thus, even though
the grades from abroad do not show on your WU transcript, professional and graduate schools will see the grades on the foreign transcript. The Study Abroad Office will have copies of your official transcript from the host institution. You may contact our Study Abroad Office for details.
<br>
During the time you are abroad, and until the evaluation and transfer of credits is completed, your academic record at Washington University will show registration for 12 units of L99. This
serves as a placeholder to maintain your status as a full-time student. The actual number of credits transferred will be determined after receipt and evaluation of the official transcript from the abroad university (see above).
<br>
When you return, you will be able to see transfer credit on your record on WebSTAC. Specifically, if you look at the semester when you studied abroad, you will see your L99 placeholder course, L99 OSP with a number. If you have received the credits from your study abroad, then you will see 0 units as the number of credits for the semester (with a grade of N). If
you see a number other than zero, then this is still the placeholder credit and your credit has not yet been processed. For the credits to be processed, Overseas Programs must receive an original transcript from your program abroad and your email response to the credit request. In addition, the Psychology Study Abroad Coordinator also must have received the required materials (e.g.,
syllabi, APA-style literature/research report, reflection paper) before you can be awarded credit. To find your credits from abroad once they have been posted on your student record, you need to look in the ‘Other Credits’ section. The courses will show up in list format with a department (e.g., L14 English, L33 Psychology) and course number (e.g., 314 or 3ABR) and number of credits (e.g., 3). The title of your course will show up as COURSEWORK COMPLETED ABROAD or as a specific course title. Your study abroad program will show up under ‘Comments.’

grant 3 units of WU credit for each appropriate and successfully completed 2-unit UQ class.
Students in the Psychology Study Abroad Program must enroll in 10 units of UQ courses
(successful completion of which will earn 15 WU units). Of the 10 UQ units, 6 must be in
psychology courses and 4 in non-psychology courses. Of the 4 units of non-psychology courses,
at least 2 units must be in an approved course that is directly related to Australia.
Classes at the University of Queensland are graded on a scale from 1 to 7, with 7 being the
highest grade. Although the actual grades do not transfer to your academic record at Washington
University, you must earn a grade of 4 or better in a course to receive WU credit.
Of the 6 units of psychology courses, 2 units will be for the required research assistantship. The
student will enroll in PSYC 3991, Research Practicum.
<br>
PSYC 3991 is a 2-unit course, and marked as pass/fail by the supervisor, who in turn passes the
mark on to the course coordinator at UQ. Students are expected to do roughly 10 hours of
satisfactory work per week, write the required literature review/research paper, and attend the
weekly meetings of the brown bag/seminar that has been developed especially for the WU
psychology students. Absences from these meetings or failure to turn in the required written
materials to the research mentor and the Washington University Psychology Department
Coordinator will result in a failing grade for the Research Practicum.
<br>
In order to accomplish the goals of the Research Practicum:
• Students are expected to devote 10 hours per week for at least 12 weeks to aspects of the
research. This includes working in the laboratory, attending laboratory meetings, meeting
with the supervisor, and reading materials related to the project.
• In order to fulfill the educational goals of the program, it is important that students be
exposed to a variety of activities. In some cases, it is not appropriate for students to be
directly involved in all aspects of the research process (e.g., in testing or interviewing
participants and in conducting data analyses). However, students should be made familiar
with most aspects of the research endeavor. Readings are to be suggested or assigned to
assist the student in understanding the research.
• The student should meet with the research mentor at the beginning of the semester. The
student should be informed as to the project(s) on which he or she is to be involved and in
what capacities he or she will be involved. Faculty expectations regarding assessment of the
student’s performance should be outlined to the student at the beginning of the semester.
• The form of the assessment may vary from student to student, at the mentor’s discretion.
Papers, presentations, reflective log, and/or discussions of material learned are all
possibilities. The assessment will include a literature review or research paper. The mentor
should meet with the student to discuss the research paper report for at least one 30-minute
session per fortnight. In this way, the mentor can easily monitor the quality and variety of
the student's exposure to research-related activities. If required by the mentor, a reflective
log can include brief summaries and commentaries on background reading and/or library
activities. A literature review or research paper is required as part of the Research Practicum,
and students are allowed some time from their 10 hours per week quota to complete this
requirement, although it is understood that the writing of this paper certainly will entail
additional time. A copy of the literature review/research paper also must be turned in to the
Washington University Psychology Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator as part of the
required Portfolio by the due date in order for transfer credit for the assistantship to be
awarded. (Note that the copy turned in to the Study Abroad Coordinator must meet the
requirements described previously under Additional General Information.)</p>

although completion of an Ulpan is required on the program </p>
          <h4> Program Dates </h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Students may apply to study at the University of Sussex only for the spring semester of their
junior year. </li>
                <li> Academic year: mid-September ̶ early June </li>
                <li> Fall semester: mid-September ̶ mid-December</li>
                <li> Spring semester: early January ̶ early June </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Academics </h4>
              <p> The University of Sussex, one of Great Britain’s top-rated research universities, is located
outside Brighton, England, just under an hour from London by train. The website for the
University of Sussex is: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/ .
The Study Abroad Program at the University of Sussex requires completion of 75-81 units
(which then transfer as 15-16 WU units; Sussex classes typically are 15 units each). Of these, 45
units will be in psychology and the remaining units will be in a non-psychology class. Also
required is the satisfactory completion of a research internship in a psychology laboratory under
the guidance of a faculty mentor, and the completion of a written literature review or research
report (to be determined in consultation with the research mentor).
For the Psychology Study Abroad at Sussex University, the student is required to complete the
following:
• Research Internship for Washington University: 15 credits
• Two additional psychology courses (at levels 5 or 6; 15 credits each)
Courses in these Levels have included:
Economic & Consumer Psychology
Psychological Perspectives on Self & Identity
Social and Cultural Explanations
Psychobiology of Cognitive Aging & Dementia
Psychology of Appetite
Developmental Psychology
Clinical Psychology
Organisational Psychology
Art as Psychology
Psychology in Education
Contemporary Issues in Psychology
The remaining credits will be in non-psychology courses in order to give the student a broader
academic experience.
For the research internship, the students will be asked to look at the research descriptions on the
faculty web-list in Psychology: http://www.sussex.ac.uk/psychology/academic_faculty.html and provide three members of faculty in order of preference. In addition, a small number of faculty
have shown particular interests in supervising one of the students, and have provided details of
specific research projects which may be of interest. The students accepted for the Study Abroad Program will be e-mailed this information.
Students will be requested to provide their research mentor preferences by a given date. A final research paper must be written, a copy of which must be provided the Washington
University Psychology study abroad coordinator for evaluation as part of the student’s Portfolio. The research mentor at Sussex may have additional written requirements as well. The research
paper must be submitted, along with the remainder of the Portfolio, to the Washington University
Psychology Study Abroad Department Coordinator by October 1 or February 1, depending on
their semester of enrollment abroad.
All psychology study abroad students are required to complete a research assistantship. More specifically:
• Students are expected to devote 10 hours per week to aspects of the research. This includes
working in the laboratory, attending laboratory meetings, meeting with the supervisor, and reading materials related to the project.
• After being assigned a research mentor, the student will be given a list of papers that s/he is
to have read before arriving at the abroad university.
• In order to fulfill the educational goals of the program, it is important that students be
exposed to a variety of activities. In many cases, it is not appropriate for students to be
directly involved in all aspects of the research process (e.g., in testing or interviewing participants and in conducting data analyses). However, students should be familiarized with
most aspects of the research endeavor. For instance, they may be taken through the procedure, perhaps by serving as a pseudo-participant, as a pseudo-experimenter, and/or
having the procedure and its rationale explained to them. Readings are to be allocated to
assist the student in understanding the research.
• Students are to meet with their supervisor at the beginning of the semester to be certain
expectations are clear. The student should be informed as to the project(s) on which he or
she is to be involved and in what capacities.
• The form of the assessment may vary from student to student, at the supervisor's discretion.
 to any other requirements, a literature review or research report is expected as part of the
assistantship. It is to be understood that the writing of this paper certainly will entail
additional time beyond the 10 hours a week on the research. A copy of all written requirements (e.g., the literature review/research report) also must be turned in to the
Washington University Psychology Department’s Study Abroad Coordinator as part of the
required Portfolio before transfer credit for the assistantship and study abroad seminar will be
awarded.  </p>
