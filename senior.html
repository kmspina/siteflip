      <h3> Requirements </h3>
      <p> To be accepted into the Honors Program, the student must have both an overall
GPA and a Psychology GPA of 3.65 or higher. The program requires that Experimental
Psychology (Psy 301) be completed prior to entering the Honors Program. The student
also must have obtained an Honors advisor, a faculty member who agrees to serve as the
research mentor for the Honors project. (The Honors advisor generally is not the
student’s major academic advisor.) Registration for Honors requires that the prospective
Honors student meet with the Coordinator of the Honors Program (Dr. Mitchell
Sommers) to discuss the proposed project.
The principal requirement for successfully completing the Honors Program is
writing the Honors Thesis. The thesis must relate to an empirical study that was
conducted specifically for completing the Honors project. Literature reviews or other
projects that would not be considered empirical research cannot be used for completing
the Honors thesis in Psychology. Projects started as part of either independent study or
experimental psychology may be used for the Honors thesis but they must present new or
extended aspects of the original project. The thesis must provide a comprehensive report
of the Honors project including a critical review of the literature, a description of
methods and results, and a discussion of the theoretical importance of the findings. In
addition, students are required to present the findings from their investigation at the
Psychology Honors Poster Session and at the Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Research
Symposium (in the Spring). Students must also complete both semesters of the special
Honors seminar, Study for Honors (Psy 498 and 499). As part of the seminar
requirement, students will be asked to turn in a completed draft of the Introduction and
Method sections of their thesis by the end of the first semester of Honors.
Psychology 498 (WI): All students in Psychology 498 will present a 30-45
minute talk that reviews the background, rationale, and methods of the project. In
addition to providing a terrific opportunity to get feedback on the proposed project, the
presentations will serve as the basis for the writing assignments.
As of the Fall 2008 semester, Psychology 498 will fulfill the Arts and Sciences
writing intensive requirement. The writing assignments for Psychology 498 will consist
of five critiques of student presentations. Each critique will be approximately 3-5 pages
long and will include: (1) a brief summary of the presentation; (2) a critical of evaluation
of whether the background information presented provided adequate motivation for the
proposed study; (3) a consideration of the adequacy of the methodology; and (4) some
suggestions for improving the presentation and the study.
The goals of the critiques are twofold. First, writing the critiques is designed to
develop skills in critically evaluating research. This ability is essential for everyone in
today’s society (e.g., should you start drinking red wine given some of the reports about
its overall positive health effects?). Second, the ability will serve to improve writing
skills (another essential ability), by teaching students to present ideas in a clear and
organized fashion and to provide feedback to peers in a respectful and useful manner.
Grades for Psychology 498 will be based on the student's completion of an initial
draft of the Introduction and Methods sections of their Honors thesis that is acceptable
both to the student’s Honors advisor and to Dr. Sommers, and on the quality of the
written critiques. More details about the presentations, writing assignments, and grading
will be provided on the first day of class.
Psychology 499: Students in Psychology 498 will focus on completing their
written thesis, preparing a poster for the annual Honors symposium (and for the Arts and
Sciences Undergraduate Research Symposium) and presenting their results and
discussion. </p>

      <h4> Junior Year </h4>
      <p>By the end of their Junior year, students who want to participate in the Honors
Program should have an advisor who has agreed to supervise their Honors project.
Students should meet with their Honors advisor to identify potential research
questions and to obtain necessary background reading. The goal of these initial
meetings is to identify the general research question that will serve as the basis for
the student's Honors thesis. Please note that a faculty member will likely
supervise only one, or at most two, theses. Therefore, the student needs to contact
a potential Honors advisor as early as possible.
<ul>
  <li> Special note: If you are planning to study abroad during the
second semester of your Junior year, it is critical that you contact
potential advisors and develop research ideas before going abroad.
If you wait until you return from study abroad, it is most likely that
you will be unable to find an advisor for your Honors thesis and/or
complete the thesis on time. </li>
  <li> Reminder: Students must meet with Dr. Sommers Before the first
Honors class to discuss their projects. </li>

      <h4> Summer between Junior and Senior Years </h4>
      <p>It certainly is advisable to maintain contact with your Honors advisor during the
summer to continue preparations for your investigation. In fact, for a number of
research projects it may be necessary to collect pilot data and/or to begin your
Honors research during the summer. This also is the time for you to be reading
intensively the research literature related to your project. At the very least, in
addition to the reading, you need to determine how you will conduct the research
(i.e., the procedures).
<ul>
  <li> Special note: Before any research can commence, you must have
completed the necessary forms and received approval from the
relevant Human Subjects Review Committee or Animal Studies
Committee. Be sure to check with your advisor about completing
these forms. This is particularly important for students planning
on working with non-traditional populations (e.g., children or
clinical populations) because human subjects approval in these
cases can take 3-4 months </li>

    <div class="box grid_4">
      <h4> September-October </h4>
      <p>At the beginning of their Senior year, students should meet regularly with their
advisor to finalize details of the investigation. The goal should be to have
everything in place (including approval from the Human Subjects Review
Committee or Animal Studies Committee) so that data collection, if it has not
already started, can begin no later than the beginning of October.

      <h4> November-December </h4>
      <p>Students should have most of their data collected by the end of the first semester.
In addition, students will need to complete a draft of their Introduction and
Method sections.

    <div class="box grid_4">
      <h4> January-February </h4>
      <p>Students should aim to have data collection and analysis completed by the middle
of February. Students should attempt to have a complete draft of their thesis to
their advisor NO LATER THAN THE END OF FEBRUARY.

    <div class="box grid_4">
      <h4> March </h4>
      <p>Recommendations for Honors are generally due in the Dean's office by the third
week of March. As noted, students should submit a completed draft of their thesis
to their advisors by the end of February. Once your advisor provides feedback on
this initial draft, you should revise your thesis at least once (but hopefully more
than once) based on the comments you receive. The version that you hand in to
your advisor in March will be part of the final Honors recommendations.
Therefore, the thesis should be in “as close to final form" as possible by the time
the Honors recommendation is due.

    <!-- a2 box -->
    <div class="box grid_4">
      <h4> April</h4>
      <p>During April, you should continue to fine-tune your thesis. Your advisor will
provide feedback on the drafts that you submit, and you should revise your thesis
accordingly. You must turn in a final version of your thesis to your advisor as
well as to the Honors Coordinator by the last day of classes for the spring
semester.
<ul>
  <li> Students are also required to present their research
at the Psychology Honors Poster Session and at the Arts and
Sciences Undergraduate Research Symposium. You will receive
instruction on how to design and print a poster. The Psychology
Honors Poster Session is usually held on the first or second day of
the reading period and the Arts and Sciences symposium is
generally held the weekend before that. You should begin working
on your poster no later than the second week of April, as you will
need to revise it several times based on comments from your
advisor.  </li>

      <h3> Registering for Honors </h3>
      <p>Study for Honors is a two-semester program (see Requirements on page 1.) In the first
semester, you will be enrolled for Psy 498; the second semester you will be enrolled for
Psy 499. Before registering for Honors, however, you must submit a Petition for
Permission to Enroll form to the Coordinator of the Psychology Honors Program, Dr.
Mitchell Sommers. (These forms are available from the Department, and are located on
the rack in the hallway outside room 221, or from the office of the Undergraduate
Coordinator, room 207B.) The form must be signed both by you and by your Honors
advisor, and must be filed each semester.

      <h3> Policies for Optional Concentrations </h3>
      <p>Each optional concentration requires nine units of course work.
        A student may pursue only one optional concentration.
        Courses applied to an optional concentration may not be used to fulfill any other requirement for the major.
        If two courses completed for an optional concentration fall within the same distribution, then that distribution is satisfied.
        These optional concentrations are available only to University College students admitted to a Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Psychology.
