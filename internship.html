      <h2>Internship Basics</h2>
      <p> An internship in psychology gives you an opportunity to apply theories and principles you’ve been learning in your psychology courses to the “real world” of social service agencies, medical institutions, the criminal justice system, business, and industry.  During an internship, you can explore career interests, develop preprofessional skills, see how community organizations work, expand your clinical and interpersonal skills, and, in many cases, help others.  An internship is a great way to enrich your own college experience while making a valuable contribution to the St. Louis community.
<br>In addition to the rewards, an internship in psychology requires a serious commitment of time and energy.  You’ll be required to attend training and regular supervision sessions at your internship site, and you must complete a minimum of 150 hours of work at your internship site to be eligible for course credit (that’s approximately 10 hours per week over the course of a usual semester).  In addition, you’ll complete a written journal throughout the internship to demonstrate what you are learning.
<br>The Psychology Department maintains a list of approved internship sites from which you can choose (see the listing later in this guide).  Opportunities exist in agencies that provide criminal and offender services, supportive treatment for individuals with mental illness, services to the elderly and chronically ill, support for abused children, services to developmentally disabled adults and children, and emergency services.  But you don’t need to limit yourself to the organizations on this list.  Alternative internship sites are possible if you identify an organization, make contact with a potential supervisor, and provide information to the Internship Coordinator for approval at least six weeks prior to beginning the internship.

      <h2>Summer Internships </h2>
      <p> Internships for credit are also possible during the summer.  You can choose from one of the Psychology Department’s approved sites or propose your own organization in St. Louis or elsewhere (if you plan to return home for the summer, for instance).  All the usual requirements remain the same, including the 150-hour time commitment.
If you are considering a summer internship, contact the Internship Coordinator no later than April 15 to discuss your ideas.  If you have an organization in mind, bring information to the Coordinator about the organization and the work you would be doing.  The Coordinator will review that information and decide whether the internship meets the Psychology Department standards.  Approval is required before you start the internship, and in no case is credit given retroactively for summer internships.  Note that, ordinarily, you complete the internship in the summer and then register for PSY 225 in the fall semester that follows, receiving final credit at the end of the fall semester. Be sure that will work with your fall registration credits.

      <h6>2) Select an internship organization</h6>
      <p> Basic information on the internship sites that are currently approved by the Psychology Department is provided later in this guide.  If you want to intern at one of these agencies, first study this information to determine whether you meet the particular agency’s requirements.  Then call the contact person at the agency to a) determine whether the site is currently accepting students and b) make an appointment for an interview.
<br>Before you meet or talk with the contact person at the agency, be sure you have thought about the learning goals you want to pursue.  Although your goals can be refined during or as a result of this conversation, most supervisors stress the need for students to have clear goals they wish to work toward.  You can talk with as many agencies as you wish before making a final selection of an internship site.
<br>When you meet with the contact person, bring a Petition to Enroll in Internship form (available at the end of this guide).  You complete sections I and II.  Have the contact person complete Section III, the Agency Approval section.
<br>After your interview, submit this form, along with other materials described below, to the Internship Coordinator in the Psychology Department.  The signature must be of the contact person who is listed in this guide (unless that person is no longer with the organization or their responsibilities have changed.)  We have developed relationships with specific professionals at each agency to handle training, supervision, and evaluation, and we ask you to respect these specific relationships.
<ul>
  <li>When we consider new sites, we are interested in the following:
    <ul>
      <li> The agency offers a service that is directly relevant to the field of psychology, and the student’s work at the internship also would be related to psychology.</li>
      <li>The student will receive adequate training and orientation.</li>
      <li>The student will receive face-to-face supervision at least once per week by a professional with graduate training in psychology, social work, or a related field.</li>
      <li>The agency is willing to work with the Internship Coordinator to monitor and evaluate student progress.</li>
</p>

    <!-- a box -->
    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-8 col-md-10 col-lg-12">
      <h6> 3) Enroll in the internship </h6>
      <p> Submit the following materials to the Internship Coordinator:
        <ul>
          <li>Completed and signed Petition to Enroll in Internship form.</li>
          <li>A printout of your student record (unofficial copy from WebSTAC or the Registrar is fine).</li>
          <li>A photocopy of your driver’s license (to verify your age).</li>
          <li>Verification of your psychology major status (obtained from Sharon Corcoran, Coordinator for Undergraduate Studies), unless your major is indicated on your student record.</li>
The Internship Coordinator will register you for PSY 225; you cannot register yourself for the course.  Under no conditions will Petitions to Enroll in Internship be accepted after the University’s deadline for adding a course in a given semester.  This deadline usually occurs about two weeks after the first day of classes in each semester and is designated in the Course Listings calendar as the last day to add a course.

      <h6>4) Complete the internship.</h6>
      <p> When you bring your enrollment materials to the Internship Coordinator, you will discuss how frequently you will meet or communicate with the Coordinator during the semester and what writing assignments will be required, typically a journal of your weekly experiences.
<br>During the internship your supervisor on site will provide regular and direct supervision.  These supervisory sessions are mandatory and should be taken seriously.  Failure to meet as requested by your supervisor or failure to respond favorably to your supervisor’s recommendations may result in a grade of No Credit for the internship.
<br>At the conclusion of the internship, send in to the Internship Coordinator (by e-mail):
  <ul>
    <li>	A log of your hours at the site, totaling 150 hours.</li>
    <li>Your weekly journal.</li>
    <li>The internship evaluation form that the Internship Coordinator will send you. </li>
Once you have turned in all the required materials, the Internship Coordinator will assign you a final Credit/No Credit grade.
